Assignment for Arm Holdings

Application.class can be run to host add operation as a rest based web service on localhost:8080.

This check in was made 17 hours later because I was unable to push to upstream due to "master [rejected - non-fast-forward]" error.
This error occurred after I reshuffled some classes in packages.

In the end I had to create a new local repository and push from there.
